      " Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science and engineering that focuses on developing intelligent machines capable of performing quantitative tasks that are traditionally associated with human beings. Data structure is a collection of data elements that are organized in a particular way to facilitate efficient processing of data, different types of data structure or stutter to different kinds of applications depending on the nature of data and the operation that need to be performed. Data planning is a type of artificial intelligence that relies on artificial neural network with multiple layers to process and analyze large amount of data. These networks are trained using algorithms that adjust the weights and biases of the connections between neurons to optimize the performance on a specific task. Machine learning is a process of teaching computer to learn from the data without being explicitly programmed by analyzing and finding patterns in a large dataset. Machine learning algorithm can be used to make predictions or decisions in a variety of applications. Because its core data science is about using tools and techniques to identify patterns, generate insights and make prediction based on data, this involves working with large and complex dataset and using statistical methods and machine learning algorithm to analyze the data and uncover hidden patterns.\n"

      " Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science and engineering that focuses on developing intelligent machines capable of performing quantitative tasks that are traditionally associated with human beings. Data structure is a collection of data elements that are organized in a particular way to facilitate efficient processing of data, different types of data structure or stutter to different kinds of applications depending on the nature of data and the operation that need to be performed. Data planning is a type of artificial intelligence that relies on artificial neural network with multiple layers to process and analyze large amount of data. These networks are trained using algorithms that adjust the weights and biases of the connections between neurons to optimize the performance on a specific task. Machine learning is a process of teaching computer to learn from the data without being explicitly programmed by analyzing and finding patterns in a large dataset. Machine learning algorithm can be used to make predictions or decisions in a variety of applications. Because its core data science is about using tools and techniques to identify patterns, generate insights and make prediction based on data, this involves working with large and complex dataset and using statistical methods and machine learning algorithm to analyze the data and uncover hidden patterns.\n"
